          Yogurt is one of the most common dairy products on the market today,
          for good reason. Yogurt is a creamy, tasty addition to lots of meals.
          Greek yogurt is starting to overtake traditional yogurt in popularity
          thanks to its rich flavor and thick texture. Greek yogurt has been
          strained to remove extra liquid and whey. The result is a thicker,
          denser final product with a higher concentration of protein and
          probiotics. This thick, protein-rich yogurt offers a wide variety of
          potential uses in savory and sweet recipes. It can also be eaten
          plain.
